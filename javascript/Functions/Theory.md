# JavaScript Functions - Basic Theory

Functions are blocks of code that perform tasks when called.

There are three main types of functions:

1. **Function Declaration:** A named function created using the `function` keyword.  
2. **Function Expression:** A function assigned to a variable.  
3. **Arrow Function:** A shorter syntax for writing functions using `=>`.

Functions can take **parameters** as inputs. When you call a function, you provide **arguments** for these parameters. You can give parameters default values if no argument is passed. You can also use **rest parameters** to accept many arguments as an array.

Functions can send back a value using the **return statement**. If no return is given, the function returns `undefined`.
