# JavaScript Control Flow

Control flow statements determine the order in which code executes.

## Conditional Statements

- `if`: Executes code block if condition is true.
- `else if`: Checks additional condition if previous `if` was false.
- `else`: Executes code block if none of the previous conditions are true.
- `switch`: Selects code to execute based on value matching cases.

## Loops

- `for`: Repeats code block a set number of times.
- `while`: Repeats code block while condition is true.
- `do...while`: Executes code block once, then repeats while condition is true.

### Notes
- Use `break` to exit loops or switch cases early.
- Use `continue` to skip to the next iteration of a loop.
